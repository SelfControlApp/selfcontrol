ABOUT
-----
SelfControl is a free and open-source application for macOS that lets you block <strong>your own</strong> access to distracting websites, your mail servers, or anything else on the Internet. Just set a period of time to block for, add sites to your blacklist, and click "Start."  Until that timer expires, you will be unable to access those sitesâ€”even if you restart your computer or delete the application.

WHY YOU NEED IT
-------
Those with self-control are able to understand that it is important to persevere with difficult activities if you are to develop skill in them. ... Fundamentally, self-control allows us to enjoy the good things of life in moderation, without wanting too much, and knowing when we have had enough.
