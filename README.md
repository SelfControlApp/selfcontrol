## About

SelfControl is a free and open-source application for macOS that lets you block **your own** access to distracting websites, your mail servers, or anything else on the Internet. Just set a period of time to block for, add sites to your blocklist, and click "Start Block". Until that timer expires, you will be unable to access those sitesâ€”even if you restart your computer or delete the application.

## Building For Development

Users should always download the latest version of SelfControl from [our website][website]. If you want to contribute to SelfControl, you'll need to learn to build it for development. This can only be done on a Mac running a modern version of macOS.

1. Clone the SelfControl repo from GitHub.
2. Make sure you have a recent version of Xcode and the Xcode command-line tools installed.
3. Install [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/): `sudo gem install cocoapods`
4. Install the SelfControl dependencies using CocoaPods: `pod install`
5. Open the `selfcontrol.xcworkspace` file (**NOT** `selfcontrol.xcodeproj`)
6. Build and run (you may need to update/remove code signing settings to make it build properly)
